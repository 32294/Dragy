<p>Dragy was started in 2016 on TE and now its here on mythic to :3 As far as I know we are the only faction that has every beacon effect eveywhere, totaling 56 beacons. Althought thats not the most impressive thing... The largest maze on the server is being built here 100% by hand, the total area being around 600k blocks. Theres also many more projects planned so if you say your bored we will gladly give you something to do. Dragy also has a bunch of mob farms that you can use. We know you need space so thats why you get a 9 chunk plot ⁽ʰᶦᵉᵍʰᵗ ˡᶦᵐᶦᵗˢ ᵐᵃʸ ᵃᵖᵖˡʸ⁾. If you are active, we'd love for you to join us :3 Now for the rules and some pictures.</p>
